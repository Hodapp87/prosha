# This needs a title

## Highest priority:

- Clean up my 'parent vertex mapping' thingy, *and* come up with
  meaningful terms to discuss it.
- Do transforms compose in the *reverse* of automata_scratch? This
  appears to be the case.

## Important but less critical:

- Why must I repeat myself so much in these definitions?
- Docs on modules
- Consider trampolining `to_mesh`.  My call stack seems needlessly
  deep in spots.  Can I make tail-recursive?
- Grep for all TODOs in code, really.
- Look at everything in README.md in automata_scratch.
- Implement some of the tougher examples from the above too, e.g. the
  triple nested spiral.  See `examples.py`.

## If I'm bored:

- Fix links in tri_mesh docs that use relative paths & do a PR?
- Look in https://www.nalgebra.org/quick_reference/# for "pour
  obtain".  Can I fix this somehow?  Looks like a French-ism that made
  its way in.
