# This needs a title

## Highest priority:

- Fix `OpenMesh.connect()`.
- Continue converting `curve_horn_*`.

## Important:

- Grep for all TODOs in code, really.
- Look at everything in README.md in automata_scratch.
- Implement some of the tougher examples from the above too, e.g. the
  triple nested spiral
- Lots of Rust-kosher refactoring (once I understand Rust better)
- Actual Rust-style docs!

## If I'm bored:

- Fix links in tri_mesh docs that use relative paths & do a PR?
